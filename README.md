### This is a Learning Journey for Myself to Save My Progress in Java
## Day One: Inheritance: 
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
The class that inherits is called the subclass or child class,
and the class being inherited from is called the superclass or parent class.
## Day Two: overloading
Today is about overloading. it improves readability and at the end you have clean code.overloading should not be confused with overriding. I tried to use overloading by changing parameter names or types or by changing the number of parameters.
