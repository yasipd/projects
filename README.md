### This is a Learning Journey for Myself to Save My Progress in Java
## Day One: Inheritance 
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
The class that inherits is called the subclass or child class,
and the class being inherited from is called the superclass or parent class.
## Day Two: overloading and Method overriding
overloading : it improves readability and at the end you have clean code.overloading should not be confused with overriding. I tried to use overloading by changing parameter names or types or by changing the number of parameters.
overriding :you have a parent class that has some method that you want to use in child class but you can give it your own implementation so this is method overriding.
