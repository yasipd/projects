### This is a Learning Journey for Myself to Save My Progress in Java
## Day One: Inheritance: 
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
The class that inherits is called the subclass or child class,
and the class being inherited from is called the superclass or parent class.
## Day Two: Method Overriding 
Today is about overriding. Method overriding is a feature in OOP that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The overridden method in the subclass should have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.
